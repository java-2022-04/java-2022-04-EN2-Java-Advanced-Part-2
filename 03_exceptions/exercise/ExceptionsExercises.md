1. Implement a simple command line calculator which has a public method divide(Integer a, Integer  b).
2. Think of what exceptions you would have to deal with and implement those. What is the type of those Exceptions?
   e.g. divide(null, 2), divide(1, 2), divide(45, 0),...
3. Refactor your Calculator so, that it can take in the two Arguments to divide from the user input via command line. 
4. Implement your own meaningful CalculationException and throw it in case of wrong input.
